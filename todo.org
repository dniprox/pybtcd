* Questions
** Consider read_element differs from int32 vs uint32

* Move const in test case out in one file

* change: read_variable_bytes and read_var_bytes are too similar

* The unittest seems very slow at some tests, figure out why

* In unitest, use self.assert raise, checkout why not work before

* Refacor the import things
* txscript/standard txscript/script very messy
* Change the mix ecdsa cryptools thing in btcec to ecdsa methods
* Change the ScriptNum to subclass int? and other same class can also do so.
* Finish test case for txscript
